Views That Are Not Modifiable
If the view query contains any of the following constructs, the view is not inherently modifiable and you therefore cannot perform inserts, updates, or deletes on the view:

Set operators

Aggregate functions

GROUP BY, CONNECT BY, or START WITH clauses

The DISTINCT operator

Joins (however, some join views are updatable)

USER_UPDATABLE_COLUMNS 

Triggers events:

System events

Database startup and shutdown

Data Guard role transitions

Server error message events

User events

User logon and logoff

DDL statements (CREATE, ALTER, and DROP)
